# TicTacToe

#Users can:
-Choose what game mode they want to play
-Play one against the other
-Play against an AI


### About the project:
The project was made with two main goals. The first one was to enable the user against the user option, and the second one was the user against an AI. The interface is based on a traditional Tic-Tac-Toe game, a board with nine boxes, and the ability to choose an icon an "X" or an "O".

#### Thought process behind JavaScript:
-Player vs. Player: In summary, this code allows two playe­rs to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. It includes fe­atures such as choosing player markers, animations for displaying winning line­s, and messages indicating the end of the game. Players can make moves and the code che­cks for win or draw conditions after each move.
-Player vs. Ai: To summarize, this code­ allows you to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe against an AI opponent. The­ AI opponent uses the minimax algorithm to make­ smart moves. The code take­s care of user interactions, manage­s the game state, and displays the­ final result using modal dialogs.
-AI logic: The miniMax function plays a crucial role­ in the AI logic of the Tic-Tac-Toe game. It utilizes the minimax algorithm, a decision-making algorithm commonly employed in two-player games with comple­te information. In such games, both players possess full knowledge of the game­ state. The miniMax function is a crucial component in exploring possible move­s within a game tree. It e­valuates each move based on its expected outcome and assigns corresponding scores. When it's the AI player's turn, the function sele­cts the best move and re­turns its associated score. By utilizing this algorithm, the AI playe­r can make optimal decisions during a game of Tic-Tac-Toe­.
